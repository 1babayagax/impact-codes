An oil factory has N number of containers and each has a different capacity.
 * During renovation, the manager decided to make some changes with the containers. He wishes to make different pairs for the containers in such a way that in the the first pair, the container of maximum capacity is paired with the container of minimum capacity, and so on for the rest of the containers,
 * to maintain balance throughout all the pairs of containers.
 * 
 * Write an algorithm to make different pairs of containers in such a way that the first container in the pair is of maximum capacity and second container in the pair is of minimum capacity. 
 * 
 * Input
 * The first line of the input consists of an integer - numContainers, representing the number of containers (N).
 * The next line consists of N space-separated integers - cont1, cont2,....contN, representing container capacity.
 * 
 * Output
 * Print K lines consisting of two space-separated integers representing the pairs that will be formed to maintain the balance by pairing the container of maximum capacity with the container of minimum capacity and so on.*
